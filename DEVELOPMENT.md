# Development

* Successfully got the base app to compile and run
* Added ofSoundPlayers to play music/the background beat in a loop
    * Put the beat player in a thread as I wanted the beat/music to go continuously, regardless of what happens in the game
        * To start the thread, had to pass a pointer to a member function


Notes:
- work on rhythm matching
