`# Project Proposal

I plan on creating a rhythm game with inspirations from the game [Patapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patapon).

Their will be a little character of currently undecided appearance that will move in a side-scrolling fashion and attack some monsters.

Commands will be issued via timed drumbeats from the player. The drumbeats will be simulated by keyboard presses on the arrow keys. The effectiveness of the commands actions will be determined by how well the player matches tempo. If the player is too off, the action will not be carried out.

Things to accomplish:

- Figure out how to maintain a clock to gauge how on-tempo drumbeats are
- Animate a walking/attacking animation
- Sounds for drumbeats, attacks, music, etc.

Expected final product:
- A rhythm game with beat matching detection and simple graphical physics
- Control 1 patapon (eyeball)
- Beat the drum, accomplish tasks, but patapon will probably stay still

First week:
- I expect to have accurately implemented beat matching

Second week:
- I expect to have non animated visual sprites with boss health and damage elements working

Third week:
- I expect to have animated visuals with projectiles animated with the Box2D physics engine

Extra time:
- Improve all visuals/animations
- Add more mechanics like walking
- Add more patapons
