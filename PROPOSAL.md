# Project Proposal

I plan on creating a rhythm game with inspirations from the game [Patapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patapon).

Their will be a little character of currently undecided appearance that will move in a side-scrolling fashion and attack some monsters.

Commands will be issued via timed drumbeats from the player. The drumbeats will be simulated by keyboard presses on the arrow keys. The effectiveness of the commands actions will be determined by how well the player matches tempo. If the player is too off, the action will not be carried out.

Things to accomplish:

- Figure out how to maintain a clock to gauge how on-tempo drumbeats are
- Animate a walking/attacking animation
- Sounds for drumbeats, attacks, music, etc.
