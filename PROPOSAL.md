# Project Proposal

I plan on creating a rhythm game with inspirations from the game [Patapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patapon).

Their will be a little character of currently undecided appearance that will move in a side-scrolling fashion and attack some monsters.

Commands will be issued via timed drumbeats from the player. The drumbeats will be simulated by keyboard presses on the arrow keys.

Things to accomplish:

- Figure out how to maintain a clock to gauge how on-tempo drumbeats are
- Animate a walking/attacking animation
- Sounds for drumbeats, attacks, music, etc.
